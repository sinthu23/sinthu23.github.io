				<p>Hello! Welcome to my professional portfolio, where I hope you can learn a little about me.</p>

				<p>My name is Sinthu and I am a working professional in New York. I graduated from Rutgers University with a Bachelors degree in Health Administration and Human Resource Management. Since graduating, I have launched my career in the marketing field, specifically within the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.</p>

				<p>What I enjoy about the marketing field, is that it is so broad and allows you to be exposed to different areas within and gather a vast variety of skills. It is a constantly changing field and helps you adapt to working in different situations. Please feel free to browse my website for an in-depth overview on my experience within my marketing career.</p>

		<h3 id="second">About Me</h3>
		<p>In the past I have interned at Sanofi Pasteur as a Marketing and Sales intern. During my time here, I was able to gain insight into the world of marketing and launched the Fluzone High Dose 2017 digital and televised campaign. I worked alongside my team to create unique marketing tools to drive consumer awareness. I also supported the multimillion-dollar department budget and studied how to maximize company investment, ensure strong ROI, and develop consumer engagement metrics. </p>

		<p>I have continued to develop my marketing skills at AARP, where my role was to study the market to identify issues with people ages 50 and older face. During my time here, I utilized several different social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, to advertise the benefits of AARP, increase event attendance, and strengthen the overall brand. I also published articles on AARP New York's website about general issues and movements happening throughout the state.</p>

		<p>I currently work for Mount Sinai Health System as a marketing associate. I lead the reporting on metrics related to all media relations activities including strategic priorities, academic departments and Health System initiatives. I also write creative content for internal and external channels.</p>
